# Text-to-Image Generation for Architecture & Home Interiors

This repository contains the code and data pipeline for a text-to-image generation project focused on houses, architecture, and home interiors. The project involves scraping images along with textual descriptions, storing them in MongoDB, performing data analysis, and training a deep learning model (e.g., conditional GAN or diffusion model) to generate images from text prompts.

## Project Overview

Text-to-image generation has gained significant attention with advances in deep learning. This project aims to generate high-quality images of houses, architecture, and interior designs from textual descriptions. The main components include:

- **Data Collection:** Web scraping and public datasets.
- **Data Storage:** Using MongoDB to manage images and metadata.
- **Data Analysis:** Preprocessing and exploratory analysis of images and text.
- **Model Training:** Implementing and training a deep learning model (e.g., conditional GAN or diffusion model) to generate images.
- **Evaluation:** Using metrics such as FID, CLIP score, and human evaluation to assess generated images.
